JavaScript last.fm API Readme
-----------------------------

Overview
--------

The JavaScript last.fm API allows you to call last.fm API methods and get the
corresponding JSON responses. Basically it just acts as a wrapper that gives
easy access to API methods. Responses can be cached using the localStorage API.


Encoding
--------

You don't need to worry about encoding when calling API methods. Everything
should automatically be UTF-8 encoded and decoded by your browser if you set
the Content-Type for your document to UTF-8:

	<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html;charset=utf-8" />


Authentication
--------------

It's easy to fetch a session for a user account. This allows you to perform
actions on that account in a manner that is secure for last.fm users. All
write services require authentication.


Write methods
-------------

Due to technical restrictions it's not possible to get a response when calling
write methods. Reading responses is only possible using HTTP Access-Control,
which is currently not supported by the last.fm API.


Submissions [aka Scrobbling]
-----------

The Submissions API currently doesn't have a JSONP or Cross-Domain supported response (for the handshake), 
so this library includes a PHP hack to get around that for now (it should be supported in the near future).

The Scrobbling handshake is done implicitly if the session, now-playing url, and submissions url are not
already stored in the cookies.

Remember to set the 'callback url' in your LastFM API account to the same page that is making the handshake
(It will be accessed in a popup window).

/* Create a LastFM object */
var lastfm = new LastFM({
	apiKey    : 'f21088bf9097b49ad4e7f487abab981e',
	apiSecret : '7ccaec2093e33cded282ec7bc81c6fca',
	cache     : cache
});

/* Submit a track that was played */
lastfm.submissions.submission({
	'username' : 'tiegz',
	'a[0]' : "the dismemberment plan", 
	't[0]' : "the city", 
	'o[0]' : 'P', 
	'r[0]' : 'L', 
	'b[0]' : 'emergency', 
	'l[0]' : '265', 
	'n[0]' : '9'
});


Usage
-----

You need to add the following scripts to your code in order to work with the
JavaScript last.fm API:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="lastfm.api.md5.js"></script>
	<script type="text/javascript" src="lastfm.api.js"></script>

If you want to use caching, you need to add another script:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="lastfm.api.cache.js"></script>

Built in JSON support should be available in modern browsers, if you want to
be sure it's supported, include the following line:

	<script type="text/javascript" src="http://www.json.org/json2.js"></script>

Now you can use the JavaScript last.fm API like this:

	/* Create a cache object */
	var cache = new LastFMCache();

	/* Create a LastFM object */
	var lastfm = new LastFM({
		apiKey    : 'f21088bf9097b49ad4e7f487abab981e',
		apiSecret : '7ccaec2093e33cded282ec7bc81c6fca',
		cache     : cache
	});

	/* Load some artist info. */
	lastfm.artist.getInfo({artist: 'The xx'}, {success: function(data){
		/* Use data. */
	}, error: function(code, message){
		/* Show error message. */
	}});
